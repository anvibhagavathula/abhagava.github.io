							<h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
							<p>Hello! I'm Anvita Bhagavathula, a recently graduated senior from Brown University with a degree in Physics (Sc.B) and Applied Mathematics (A.B). I am an incoming Master's student at Cornell University (Cornell Tech) in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
							<p>I am interested in using simulation techniques, such as <strong>molecular dynamics</strong> and <strong>density functional theory</strong>, to investigate physical systems. I want to explore how we can combine simulations with AI/ML techniques to better predict the behavior of these systems to accelerate the drug or materials discovery processes. I am also interested in exploring how we can make these AI/ML architectures more <strong>domain-informed, interpretable, and trustworthy</strong>. My research has a track record of being used to solve tangible problems in industry, academic, and startup settings.</p>
							<p>I am currently a deep learning research intern at <a href="https://www.aqemia.com/", style="color:#2986cc">Aqemia</a>, a French drug-discovery startup, where I am researching physically-informed graph neural network architectures to predict likelihood of reaction synthesis to accelerate the rate at which drug candidates are optimized. I am also a part of the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/home", style="color:#2986cc">The Crunch Group</a> at Brown University where I investigate neural networks as function approximators to solve differential equations by integrating governing physical laws into their architectures. In addition to my experience with physically-motivated deep learning research, I have extensive experience using Density Functional Theory (DFT), an ab-initio quantum mechanical simulation technique, to study the superconducting phase in 2D graphene systems as part of the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/li-lab/#:~:text=In%20the%20low%20dimensional%20electronic,or%20few%20layers%20of%20atoms.", style="color:#2986cc">Low-Dimensional Electronics Lab</a> at Brown.</p>
							<p>In the past, I have also worked with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/", style="color:#2986cc">Research for Industry</a> group at Microsoft Research where I developed an interpretable machine-learning based model to predict food protein digestibility using a QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) approach. More details about my research projects can be found <a href="#research", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>
							<p>In my free time, I love to play the bass, sing, and paint. I also love film photography and you can find some of my photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anvi_film/", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>

										<dt, id="graphs"><strong>Filtering Synthesizable Reactions Using Graph Neural Networks [June 2023 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Supervised by Jacques Boitreaud and Dr. Antoine Brochard, I am working as a deep learning research intern at Aqemia, a French startup building an end-to-end drug discovery pipeline using quantum physics and AI. Here, I am developing graph neural network architectures that can best determine whether a SMILES reaction template is synthesizable or not. My goal is to find the best input data representation as well as an architecture that captures physical information of these reactions to build this model. So far, I have proposed and implemented several unique representations of SMILES reaction template strings using sub-graphs and encoded reaction sites to pool on. My model would help accelerate the rate at which promising drug candidates are filtered, optimized, and synthesized within this startup.</p>										<dt, id="adapt"><strong>Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks [Oct 2022 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dt, id="adapt"><strong>Neural Networks as Differential Equation Solvers [Oct 2022 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Advised by Dr. Somdatta Goswami, I created a self-adaptive physics-informed neural network (PINN) that solves a one-dimensional differential equation with two other students using Jax. To do so, we designed a custom loss function for our model that enforced the structure of the governing solution and its boundary condition behavior. We then created an adaptive regularizer that penalized the boundary loss terms during training to produce more accurate solutions. We are now applying these concepts to investigate Deep Operator Networks. The repository/code for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/philipladuca24/PINNs-Project", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/PINNs_Poster.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										<dt, id="dft"><strong>Using Density Functional Theory to Study Superconductivity in 2D Graphene Systems  [June 2021 - May 2023]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>For my Honors Senior Thesis, I worked at the interface of experiment and theory by applying ab-initio quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the mechanism behind the superconducting phase in 2D graphene systems.</p>
											<p>Supervised by Dr. Jia Li at Brown University's low-dimensional electronics lab, I built a nano-electronic device from graphene to measure its unique superconducting and magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures. Building this device provided me experience with several innovative fabrication techniques like graphene exfoliation using scotch tape, nano-circuit design in DesignCAD Express, and electron beam lithography. I received an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award to pursue this research.</p>
											<p>I facilitated a collaboration with the Department of Chemistry to better understand this graphene system theoretically. Supervised by Professor Brenda Rubenstein, I computationally modelled this system. I developed a Python program to generate its structure and then ran several electronic structure calculations using Density Functional Theory, a quantum mechanical modelling technique. Specifically, I generated its band structure and density of states. </p>
										</dd>
										<dt, id="protein"><strong>Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Protein Digestibility [June 2022 - August 2022]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Advised by Dr. Sara Malvar and Dr. Ranveer Chandra at Microsoft Research, I developed an interpretable machine-learning based method to predict food protein digestibility, a value normally determined using invasive animal experimentation. To tackle this problem, I first created a 2000-point ground-truth protein property dataset that mapped features such as food nutritional information and protein sequence embeddings, extracted from a pre-trained transformer model, to digestibility coefficients. Then, I used Shapley value analysis to only select features that had established relationships to protein digestibility in the literature to train tree-based models on. We found that this biologically-interpretable dimensionality reduction was key in achieving the high accuracies our models did through an ablation study. After the summer, I co-authored a paper summarizing our findings that is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00625", style="color:#2986cc">arXiv</a>. The downstream impact of these results is the reduction of solely animal guided experimentation in the development of new food products.</p>

								<h3>Member: Physics Departmental Diversity and Inclusion Committee</h3>
								<p>I address diversity and inclusion issues within the Physics department in a committee of undergraduates, doctoral students, and faculty. One of the projects I significantly contributed to was designing a climate survey to collect data regarding the state of diversity in the department which received over 100 responses. I have been a part of this committee since January 2021.</p>
