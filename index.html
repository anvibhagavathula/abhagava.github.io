							<h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
							<p>Hello! I'm Anvita Bhagavathula, a senior at Brown University pursuing a degree in Physics (Sc.B) and Applied Mathematics (A.B).</p>
							<p>I am interested in researching simulation techniques, such as <strong>molecular dynamics</strong> and <strong>density functional theory</strong>, to study physical systems. I want to explore how we can combinine simulations with AI/ML techniques to better predict the behavior of these systems and accelerate the drug or materials discovery processes. I am also interested in exploring how we can make these AI/ML architecutres more <strong>domain-informed, interpretable, and trustworthy</strong>.</p>
							<p>I am currently applying for PhD programs in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science & Engineering. I am also applying to 1-year residency programs and internships to help me hone my research abilities before I start my PhD. </p>
							<p>I am a part of Brown's <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/li-lab/#:~:text=In%20the%20low%20dimensional%20electronic,or%20few%20layers%20of%20atoms.", style="color:#2986cc">low-dimensional electronics lab</a> where I am studying the properties of twisted multilayer graphene systems using density functional theory for my senior thesis. I am also a research assistant at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/home", style="color:#2986cc">The Crunch Group</a> where I am designing and implementing self-adaptive PINNs (physics-informed neural networks) to solve differential equations in data-poor regimes. In the past, I have worked with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/", style="color:#2986cc">Research for Industry</a> group at Microsoft Research where I developed an interpretable machine-learning based model to predict food protein digestibility using a QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) approach. More details about my research projects can be found <a href="#", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>

										<dt, id="adapt"><strong>Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks [Oct 2022 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Advised by Dr. Somdatta Goswami, I created a self-adaptive physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve a one-dimensional differential equation in a team of three students using Jax. To do so, we designed a custom loss function for our model that enforced the structure of the solution and its boundary condition behavior. We then created an adaptive regularizer that penalized the boundary loss terms during training to produce more accurate solutions. We are now working on adaptively optimizing the number of collocation points our model uses to generate well-defined solutions in data-poor regimes. The repository/code for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/philipladuca24/PINNs-Project", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>

										<dt, id="protein"><strong>Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Protein Digestibility [June 2022 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Advised by Dr. Sara Malvar this past summer, I developed an interpretable machine-learning based method to predict food protein digestibility, a value normally determined using invasive animal experimentation. To tackle this problem, I first created a 2000-point ground-truth protein property dataset that mapped features such as food nutritional information and protein sequence embeddings, extracted from a pre-trained transformer model, to digestibility coefficients. Then, I used Shapley value analysis to only select features that had established relationships to protein digestibility in the literature to train tree-based models on. We found that this biologically-interpretable dimensionality reduction was key in achieving the high accuracies our models did through an ablation study. After the summer, I co-authored a paper summarizing our findings that is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00625", style="color:#2986cc">arXiv</a>.</p>

										<dt, id="dft"><strong>Investigating Multilayer Graphene Systems Using Density Functional Theory [June 2021 - Present]</strong></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I studied 2D materials from an experimental and computational lens through my undergraduate research. Supervised by Professor Jia Li at Brown's low-dimensional electronics lab, I built a nano-electronic device from twisted tri-layer graphene to measure its unique superconducting properties at cryogenic temperatures during my junior year. Building this device provided me experience with several innovative fabrication techniques like graphene exfoliation using scotch tape, nano-circuit design in DesignCAD Express, and electron beam lithography. I received an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award to pursue this research and portion of the experimental work that I did involving atomic force microscopy is summarised in the poster below.</p>
											<p>My curiosity to understand this device theoretically drove me to initiate a collaboration with the Department of Chemistry for my senior thesis research. Mentored by Professor Brenda Rubenstein, I am now simulating my device's properties using density functional theory (DFT). My next steps are to develop a cluster-based method to combat DFT's scaling problem when modeling large systems and try to simulate my device's properties more accurately.</p>
